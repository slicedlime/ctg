# Command Training Grounds

This is the Command Training Grounds, a companion map for my [Learn Minecraft Commands Tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4ZS2guXqa_jVrj73ZBl4zkkz_BdEVEb5).

The map is packaged and released in sync with episodes, using a python script to generate all versions of the map. Lessons for future episodes are included in the repository, but the "live" release is always the one belonging to the video which is currently the latest one.

# Contributing

Please use github issues to report any issues found with the map or suggest improvements. Pull requests are welcome (although note that I reserve the right to pick and choose what is accepted). For information about forks, see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

# Islands

Each lesson takes place on a new floating islands. Islands have been contributed by Ximure, JochCool, Mincerafter and GB - thank you!
